ToDoListApp interacts with the user interface (UI) through an instance of the ToDoListGUI class.
It typically creates an instance of ToDoListGUI and establishes a connection between the UI and the core functionality.

Task Management:
The class is responsible for managing tasks, such as adding tasks, removing tasks, marking tasks as completed, sorting tasks, etc.
It may use an instance of the ToDoList class (if you have one) to store and manage tasks.

Application Logic:
The class contains the core application logic and business rules.
It enforces rules for adding tasks, validating user input, and maintaining the integrity of the to-do list data.

Flow Control:
The class controls the flow of the application, guiding the user through various actions and transitions within the UI.
It may determine which actions to take based on user input or the state of the application.

Application Lifecycle:
It manages the lifecycle of the application, including initialization, execution, and termination.

Integration with Other Classes:
ToDoListApp may interact with other classes in your project, such as the Task class and potentially other utility classes or data structures you've created.
# ToDoListGUI.java
The ToDoListGUI class in your project is responsible for creating and managing the graphical user interface (GUI) of this to-do list application. It interacts with the user, displays tasks, provides input fields, buttons, and handles user interactions. In our to-do list application, the ToDoListGUI class plays a crucial role in creating an engaging and functional user interface that allows users to interact with their tasks and manage their to-do lists effectively.

User Interface Components:
The ToDoListGUI class defines and manages various user interface components, such as buttons, text areas, text fields, and labels.
It lays out these components in a way that provides an intuitive and user-friendly interface.

Task Display:
The class is responsible for displaying the list of tasks to the user. It often uses a text area or other components to show task details.

Event Listeners:
ToDoListGUI includes event listeners or action listeners for GUI components like buttons.
It listens for user interactions (e.g., button clicks) and responds by invoking corresponding actions.

Add Task Functionality:
The GUI allows users to input task information (description, due date, priority) and provides a button for adding tasks to the list.
It should handle user input validation and provide feedback for incorrect input.

View Tasks Functionality:
Users can view their list of tasks by clicking a "View Tasks" button.
The GUI retrieves and displays the list of tasks, often in a scrollable text area.

Delete Task Functionality:
There might be a way for users to delete tasks. This involves selecting a task (e.g., via checkboxes or selection) and clicking a "Delete Task" button.

Toggle Completion Status:
Users can mark tasks as completed or incomplete using a "Toggle Task Completion" button. This updates the task's status.

Sorting Tasks:
The GUI might offer sorting options, allowing users to arrange tasks by due date, priority, or other criteria.

Error Handling and Feedback:
It provides user-friendly error messages or feedback when invalid input is detected or when actions cannot be performed.

Integration with Application Logic:
The ToDoListGUI class communicates with the underlying application logic, such as the ToDoListApp class or ToDoList class, to perform actions like adding, deleting, and displaying tasks.

Layout Management:
The class manages the layout of GUI components using layout managers like FlowLayout, BorderLayout, or GridBagLayout.

Appearance and Styling:
It may define the appearance of the GUI, including fonts, colors, and other visual aspects.

User Interaction Flow:
It controls the flow of the user interaction, guiding users through the application's features and actions.

Initialization and Display:
The ToDoListGUI class often initializes and displays the GUI when the application is launched.

Responsive Design:
It ensures that the GUI is responsive and behaves correctly when users resize the application window.

Certainly! saveTasksToFile and loadTasksFromFile are functions that can add real functionality to your project, especially in the context of a to-do list application. Here's a description of how these functions work and how they enhance your project:

saveTasksToFile Function:

Purpose: The saveTasksToFile function is responsible for saving the list of tasks to a file. This is crucial for preserving the user's to-do list data between sessions, ensuring that tasks are not lost when the application is closed and reopened.
How it works:
It takes an ArrayList<Task> (in your case, tasks) as an input.
It opens an ObjectOutputStream to a specified file (e.g., "tasks.ser").
It writes the tasks ArrayList to the file using serialization.
Serialization allows you to convert complex objects (in this case, a list of tasks) into a format that can be easily saved to a file and later deserialized to reconstruct the objects.
Real-world application: When a user adds, edits, or removes tasks in your to-do list application, you can call this function to persistently store the updated task list. This ensures that the user's data is preserved even if the application is closed or the computer is restarted.
loadTasksFromFile Function:

Purpose: The loadTasksFromFile function is responsible for loading previously saved tasks from a file. It allows your application to retrieve and display the user's existing to-do list.
How it works:
It takes the filename (e.g., "tasks.ser") as an input.
It opens an ObjectInputStream to read from the specified file.
It reads the serialized data from the file and deserializes it into an ArrayList<Task>.
The deserialized list of tasks is returned to the caller, which can then be used to update the application's task list.
Real-world application: When the user launches your to-do list application, you can call this function to retrieve their previously saved tasks. This allows users to continue working with their existing tasks, providing a seamless and persistent experience.
In summary, these functions are essential for implementing data persistence in your to-do list application. They ensure that tasks are saved to a file when the user wants to save their progress and loaded from the file when the user wants to resume their work. This data persistence feature enhances the usability and reliability of your application, making it more practical for users to manage their tasks over time.
